# Stories with Data

A repository for managing the (still theoretical) [Stories with Data](http://storieswithdata.herokuapp.com/) newsletter.

If all goes to plan this will be a monthly newsletter focused on journalism and storytelling with data and computer assisted reporting. Although there is some overlap, it will mostly stay away from the well serviced areas of web programming and data visualisation. 

## Get involved

If you've got a great idea for content (or any other great idea, actually) let us know by [submitting a ticket](https://github.com/drzax/stories-with-data-newsletter/issues).

This idea was hatched in the Stories with Data community on Slack. If you'd like to come along for the ride please [join the conversation](http://storieswithdata.herokuapp.com/), or [signup](http://eepurl.com/bv5TyH) for this still theoretical newsletter.
